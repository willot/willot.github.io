			<h3>Are you a US citizen or permanent resident?</h3>
			<p>I am a permanent resident.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Where did you hear about Atomic?</h3>
			<p>I was looking at this <a href="http://www.imagesoftinc.com/documents/pr/MI-tech-100-bigtentjobs.pdf">document</a> and I saw the name atomic object and looked for the company web site.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Why are you applying to Atomic?</h3>
			<p>When I looked at the Atomic website, I was very impressed with the career page. It is very different compared to other tech companies. I was most impressed with the focus on diversity.Being a foreigner is not always easy. People tend to see each sother through stereotypes and often fail to meet and learn from those from other backgrounds. Working in research at Purdue and Michigan State showed me how groups from diverse backgrounds can work together to accomplish amazing things. I would love to work in place that recognizes and values diversity.</p>

			<h3>Tell me about the first program you were proud of.</h3>
			<p>I made a small game in javascript for challenge we had to do. It was a magician shooting at different type of targets. You had to manage mana, life, resistance of the target to different spells. I had lot of fun doing it. I was very proud because I was able to write this program only after a few days of learning Javascript.I also got very good feedback about this program.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Do you have any hobby projects?</h3>
			<p>I recently started to create a secret santa website for my family. My family does a secret santa gift exchange each year for Christmas. The website will randomly draw names and include a wish list for each participant.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>What is your favorite programming language? Why? What would you do to improve it?</h3>
			<p>I have learned Ruby and Javascript. As a novice software developer, I have a preference for Ruby. I like that Ruby is based on convention and that you can find very good support online. There is amazing documentation and the error statements are useful, unlike Javascript error messages.I also really enjoy the use of class and module. Ruby code is very visually organized. One small thing that I would change is have the array index start at 1.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>What are you planning on learning next?</h3>
			<p>I have more to learn about Ruby and Javascript but I would also love to learn new language like Clojure or .Net.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Tell me about a time when you were assigned a project that relied on technology unfamiliar to you.</h3>
			<p>For our final project at Dev Bootcamp, we created a travel website that used an API. This API came with little to no information on how to use it. We started by finding as much information as we could. From there we realized that the API used a SOAP protocol. We didn't know anything about this protocol. After doing more research, we found a gem called Savon that let Ruby handle the SOAP protocol. Wewere then able to feed and get the data from the API. We organized our team to collect information, experimented, and acknowledged when we were stuck. We went back to doing more research and asked for assistance as needed.</p>

			<h3>Tell me about a time you failed at something. What did you learn from the experience?</h3>
			<p>After completing my master's degree at Michigan State UniversityI moved to Lafayette to start a PhD at Purdue university. After a year and a half a realized that a career in academia was not for me and I chose to stop working towards my PhD.At this time I did not have a clear career path and I felt i had failed. I reevaluate my priorities, took a close look at my personal and professional strengths, and set new goals for myself. I decided to start a new career in software development and took steps towards accomplishing this. I learned the importance of focusing on my goals and taking opportunities available to me.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>What do you find most gratifying about software development?</h3>
			<p>The idea of starting something from scratch and building on it is really rewarding. Another aspect of software development that I enjoy is the teamwork. I enjoy exchanging ideas and helping others. It is not a solo game, but a team effort.</p>
		</li>

			<h3>Tell me something interesting about yourself</h3>
			<p>I was born in northern France near the city of Lille. I lived and studied in southern France until my love of travel landed my in the US when I was 26 years old. I did not know anyone in the US and new very little english at the time. I had the opportunity to study at Michigan State University where I also met my wife. I've decided to live and raise a family in the US but hope to continue to travel and explore other cultures.  </p>
