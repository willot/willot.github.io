        <h3>Integer vs String</h3>
        <p>
        The <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/String.html">definition</a> of string in Ruby-Doc is: 
        "A String object holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of bytes, typically representing characters. 
        String objects may be created using String::new or as literals." 
        This is a very formal definition. I guess you can simply see a string as words. A list of words included in "" is seen 
        as one object and not has individual objects.Nevertheless number can also be a string if we transform them using the method
        to_s.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Integer.html">definition</a> of integer in Ruby-Doc is even more dry: 
        "Integer is the basis for the two concrete classes that hold whole numbers, Bignum and Fixnum."
        We are going to ignore the concept of class for now. Integers are just whole numbers. You can change an integer to a "float"(aka: decimal number)
        by using the method to_f. You can also set the number of decimal that you want to return.
        </p>
        <p>Integers and Strings are both objects in Ruby (as is everything in Ruby) however, Strings and Integers are different types of objects and
        therefore have methods that can act upon them. For example, you cannot divide two strings like you can divide an integer 
        (however, you can split them into parts).</p>
        <p>Also, integers can be converted to strings, and strings of integers can be converted to back to integers.
            Basically, you can convert the number/integer 55 to a string of "55". Furhter, you can split this string of "55" to "5" and "5" 
            and then change both of the strings of "5" back to an integer.
            
            You can technically convert a string to an integer, however it does not make sense. 
            For example, what number should the letter "a" have? I don't know. 
            If you convert a string of letters to an integer, you get a value of zero.
        </p>
        <h3>Hashes vs Array</h3>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/Array.html">definition</a> of Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.
            It is a pretty short and sweet definition that really explain what an array is. It is an object that collect object in an organize order.
            For example, a list of things, such as all of the sports cars I have. The array will be the names of the 5 cars, and the index assigned 
            to them will be the digits 0-4. In arrays we start counting with zero. ["ferrarri","ford truck","corvette","lotus","tesla"]
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/Hash.html">definition</a> of in the Ruby-Doc is 
            "A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. 
            Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type."
            For hashes, if we use the sports car example, we no longer used an integer based index, but rather whatever we want. So I could make a hash of my
            sports cars, based on the emotion each car gives me.
            So, I could have my 5 sports cars, but when I want to access any one of them, I pick the emotion I am using.
            If I am feeling "sad", I will tell the hash to give me the car associated with "sad", the red Ferrarri, ofcourse.
            The big difference between the hash and the array is that the hash can have whatever it wants as a key.
            {rich => ferrerri, good => "ford truck", sad =>"corvette", great =>"lotus", green =>"tesla"}
        </p>
        <p>Hashes and arrays as strings and integers have their own specific methods. Some are similars some are different. You can see the list
            of all the methods on the ruby Doc linked with the definition.
