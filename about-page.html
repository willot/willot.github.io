    		<p> I graduated from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/"> Dev Bootcamp Chicago</a> last February. It has been a great experience. It is a very intense program that bring people without prior coding experience together to start a new career. The program focus on learning Ruby, Ruby on rails, Javascript, SQL, PostgreSql, HTML and CSS.</p>
    		My previous background is in Agriculture/Entomology. I have a Bachelor and Master in Agriculture, Environmental Science and Food Production from <a href="http://www.isara.fr/en"> ISARA-Lyon</a> in France. I pursue my study by doing a Master in Entomology at Michigan State where I received an assistantship. My <a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/14/87/1487152.html"> thesis</a> was focus on organic cucumber production.<p>
    		<p>I always had a passion in sustainable agriculture and environment</p>
    		<p>Last year I decided to change career and follow my passion for tech and web development. This is why I enrolled in DBC. I want to develop my skills, learn new technologies and always be challenged.</p>
