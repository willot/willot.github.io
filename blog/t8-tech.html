          One more week before the going to the program in Chicago. It is getting closer!
          For today post we have been asked to choose a subject in a list. There are several subject interesting to me, like computer memory or recursion.

          The concept of computer memory is pretty cool if we really think about it. The quantity of data that we can store now is huge. At the beginning of computer we could only store a very small quantity of bites. Now we store teragigabytes like it is nothing. It is kind of amazing the quantity of information we can store. 2000 years ago if you want to store all the books of the world you had to build the library of Constantinople.  The only way to store more information was to build a bigger building or write smaller in the books. Look how long it took us to develop micro-film... Micro-film only decrease by 25 the size of the original document. Now we are storing more and more stuff on a hard drive. The really cool thing about that is that the hard drive is getting smaller or at least doesn't get bigger... Space wise we all have a Constantinople library in our house and we can hold it in our hand.<br>
          This storage is also more ephemeral. This is a big issue. The Constantinople library stood for a thousand year before to burn. We are lucky if our hard drive hold for an hundred. Nevertheless we can make copy pretty easily but that takes time and effort.

          Let speak more about the different type of memory a computer use. They are: <br>
          Primary storage<br>
          Secondary storage<br>
          Primary storage refer usually now at RAM (Random Access Memory). It is a semiconductor base memory. It is the only memory directly accessible by the CPU(central processing unit). That is the space that the CPU use to make its calculation. It limit the speed of the computer if the limit is reached. Information are nor stored there permanently. 
          The Secondary storage refer to the hard drive or CR-Rom, DVD-Rom, USB flash drive. This is where information are stored permanently. Obviously the data on this system can be erase or replace but when the information is put on this support is to give it save it. If the power is turn off voluntarily or not the data is still there. It is not the case with the primary storage. Flash Drive, CD or portable hard disk are also refer at Off-line storage.
