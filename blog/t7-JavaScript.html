    <h2>Ruby hash versus JavaScript Object</h2>
    <span id="date">10-31-2014</span>
    <div id="text_body"> 
        <p>The subject of the post of today is comparing Ruby and JavaScript. I am particularly going to look at ruby hash and JavaScript object. 
        The way we write an hash in Ruby and an object in JavaScript is pretty similar. In both case we use the "{}" parentheses.
        </p>
        <p>In ruby we can do:<br>
          hash = hash.new or hash = {} Both will create an empty hash.<br><br>
          We can also create hash that are not empty:<br>
          hash = {"lion" => "mammal", "tigershark" => "Chondrichthyes", "emerald ash borer" =>"insect"}<br>
          So this hash contains specie names as key and class as value. <br>
          You can also do:<br>
          hash = {lion:  5,  tiger_shark:  51, emerald_ash_borer:  600}<br><br>

          In JavaScript we can do:<br>
          var object_1 = {<br>
          lion: "mammal",<br>
          tigershark: "Chondrichthyes",<br>
          emerald ash borer: "insect"<br>
          }<br><br>
          It is pretty similar. The difference is the use of ':' instead of '=>' in the first case and the key value in JavaScript do not need "". <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        
        The way we access the data inside the hash or object is also similar.<br>
        hash["lion"]<br>
        => "mammal"<br><br>

        In Javascript:<br>
        console.log(hash.lion)<br>
        => "mammal"<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        One difference is that you can print the key and the value in Ruby<br>
        puts "#{key}  class is  #{value}"<br><br>
        In JavaScript it is way more complex. You can only easily access the value<br>
        console.log(hash.key)
        </p>
