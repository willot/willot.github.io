          The topping of this post is values. It is an interesting subject.<br>
          What are my values?  Which one are important to me to be fulfill, happy. I have  a list a value here and I am suppose to pick the one that count the most to me. I am wondering if I will answer the same way now that I will have answer 5 years ago or that I will answer in 5 years. Does our value change with us? I guess that is another topic...<br>
          I will try to make a list not too cheesy. Because this kind of list are suppose to be cheesy to show how awesome you are... <br>
          So by alphabetic order:<br>
          -Confidence<br>
          -Creativity<br>
          -Environmentalism<br>
          -Free time<br>
          -Health<br>
          -Honesty<br>
          -Integrity<br>
          -Knowledge<br>
          -Movement<br>
          -Persistence<br>
          -Tranquility<br>
          It is a short list. I guess I could put more. 
        </p>
        <p>I have to speak more about one of these values. It is my post so I am going to speak about two of them! The first one is health. It is kind of weird to put it has a value. I guess, it depends how you interpret it. Maybe they put it in the list has being something you work for. You eat healthy, you exercise... It is not how I see it. I see health more has something given. I mean of course you have to take care of yourself but you don't choose to be sick... I see health has a chance that we have to enjoy! Being healthy is something we should be thankful everyday!<br>
        The other value that I want to speak about is creativity. I had the chance to work in research lab for some time and it was great because creativity was something that was always push. I always enjoyed finding solution and creating stuff, searching new ideas. Thinking out of the box. I don't know if I am good at it, but I always enjoyed it! It is just something that always made me happy spending days or weeks on bibliography and developing new ideas. Asking myself, what can we do now? What is the next step or move? Being in the unknown. I enjoy it.

          The next question is how I rate myself on the value I listed... Let say if I list them it is because I try to follow them.

          This question is: when is the last time someone asked you for advices?<br>
          People don't ask me advice! I am terrible at answering them. I always ask back the question they ask me. I usually tell them what do you want? The conversation usually end up by: do what you want. Or do what you think is right. I usually tell them the best advice I ever got from an old advisor: "You are the best judge".

          Last question is about which value help me when I doubt? For me it is persistence. Just keep trying if it is what you want. Surprise people!
