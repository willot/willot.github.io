    <h2>Why you will never look at a USB devices the same way!  </h2>

        <p>This week the subject of the blog is to choose an issue that the tech industry is facing. There is a lot of them that go from place of women, to unprotected electrical grid against solar flare. I choose to speak on security today. It is a hot topic and it always will be.</p>
        <p>I like to read newspaper and in the last week I red two article on two major security issue. The first on call "BadUSB". It was first discover in July but apparently the breach was not describe because the person that found it said that there was no way to fix it. The manufacturer of USB have to change the firmware inside the key, therefore you can't change the one that already exist... But two researcher reproduce the breach and published it this month. The argument to release the information was that it will force manufacturer to correct the issue and if it was not it will never change. I am not sure it is a good argument but I can't say it is a bad one either. The problem with "BadUSB" is that someone could install anything and take control of a computer simply by introducing a USB in it. Someone could say ok I just have to make sure nobody put a USB in my computer. I guess it is not very hard to do for your personal computer but what about companies... Another problem is that it affect anything that can plug to your USB, a mouse, a keyboard... If a computer is infected to a malware that can corrupt the USB firmware then any USB device plus to it become infected. There is no easy protection against it...  It is a little scary.

        <p>The other security breach I read about is Shellshock. It was discover by St√©phane Chazelas. It is a breach in the program call BASH that is a basic component of Linux. 70% of servers in the world are equipped with it... That is a lot of target. The funny thing about this breach is its age. They estimate that the breach has been here for at least 20 years... Yep that is right! But normally free software like this are checked by hundreds of people that is the point of it. But apparently nobody really check for breach particularly for old part of software that have been there forever. It takes a lot of time and there is no reward to do it. At least the breach was only revealed when a patch was available. One major issue with this breach is that this software is install on device that don't update themselves like routers and other equipment.
