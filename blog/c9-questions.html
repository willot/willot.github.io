    <h2>How to write a good question?</h2>

        <p>That is a good question! I think it is obvious for everybody. It needs to be clear and concise. But theory and practice are different... </p>
        <p>To write something clear you need to check for grammar and punctuation.  A 'their' become a 'there', a comma missing and the meaning become really different or unclear. There is an easy solution for this: proofread! But most of us don't really do it, or overlook and don't pay attention to these small details. </p>
        <p>The second point is concise question. Sometime it is easy but other time the reason why you are asking the question is because you can't find an answer... The reason you can't find an answer is because you don't really know what to search for... It is the dog biting its tail... Good luck to you! </p>
        <p>You can try to describe what is exactly the problem. Try to write what you are doing and what you except it to do. This at least will help the other person try to understand your issue. Maybe you are totally going the wrong way, this is why it is not working...</p>
        <p>Even if you want to be concise, you have to include the important information like: what software you are using and which version too if it is important. If you are asking someone how to go somewhere, first you have to tell him where you are otherwise nobody can help you. Even if people know the answer they don't know that it is the answer you are looking for.<br>
        Then come the title of the question. If your question is short it can be the same otherwise just try to pinpoint your issue. If you can add tags to your question put the relevant one.
        </p>
        <p>Last point proofread again!<br>
        Final point: proofread again! 
        </p>
