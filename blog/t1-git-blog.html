    <h2> Version control, git, git-hub</h2>

        <p> Almost the end of my first week of phase 0 at DevBootCamp! So for the first blog post I am going to speak about version control, git and git-hub.</p>
        <p>What is a version control?  The name says it all! Not really... I guess programmers use it a lot, but anybody that do work on big projects that are going to evolve like a thesis will find it useful.  This is also very useful for team work. Basically everytime you modify a file and save it, it creates a new version of the file. So you can easily go back to your previous version. It is useful if you realize you modify a portion of your code that is not working how it is supposed to. You can go back to the previous version that was working. </p>
        <p> What is git? Git is a version control software. You install it on your hard drive and you can use it from your terminal. When you create a new file you "add"  and "commit" it. Then next time you want to work on it, you reopen the file and modify it. You save it, "add" it and then "commit" it. You have a new version of your work but the old one still exist.</p>
        <p>Last, what is Git hub? Git hub is a tool where you can transfer your file that are save on your hard drive with git, on the cloud. But it is way more than that. It lets you share your file and work in team. So if several people work on a project they can all get access to the file and transfer it on their hard drive and create branches. Then, they can modify it and push the changes on git hub without affecting the work of other people. Then the files can get merge to take the modification of everybody.</p>
