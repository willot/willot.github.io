    <h2>Class methods vs instance method</h2>

        <p>I should start this post by saying I never try to write a class method. My post is base on several article that I read and not really from my personal experience.<br> 
        There are three way to create a class method:
        </p>
        <p><img class="picture" src="../img/class method.png" /><br>
        The first and second way are the most commonly used.
        </p>
        <p>
        The advantage of using class methods are:<br>
        -Shorter code<br>
        -Decrease the number of objects<br>
        -No need of initializing the class
        </p>
        <p>From my research it seems that only  the first argument is really valid. Using Class method decrease the code. It also decrease the number of the object in the code but it is apparently really unlikely that it will really have an impact on speed of the system. The third point is criticized because it looks like a procedural and not an object oriented process. This is going against the point of using an object oriented process.
        </p>
        <p> 
        <p>Other critics are that it is harder to refactor Class method and if used should be kept short and simple. In general the point of view of people writing about class instance is negative. Their point is use it but only if it is appropriated and short. The interesting point is that I didn't really find any example on good case to use Class method. It really seems to me that at my stege of learning I should stay away from them. But it is good to know that they exist.
