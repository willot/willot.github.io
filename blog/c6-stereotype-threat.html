          If you do not know me, when you  see me you will think I am like anybody else. You know what, I am! Most of the time I wear a jeans and a baseball cap like every American. But there is a little detail in my wallet that say I am not an American. There is a green card that allow me to stay here but I am not a citizen. Also when I start to speak you will realize that I have an accent.

         Most of the people do not see anything wrong with that and are usually curious about my background but you also hear a lot of stereotype about French people. We eat stinky cheese (I must admit it is mostly true), we are lazy(????, taking vacation is not really a good indicator of how much work you do during the day), we are dirty(apparently shower only exist in US), we are controlled by government with all the rules (try to see what happen when there is a major strike because people don't agree with the government. Believe me the government change of mind quickly!) ... I can go on and on but these are the most common one.

        You will be surprise how often I hear that and people that I don't know throw that at my face. The funny think about that is that I will probably act the same way with an American if I was in France and never lived anywhere else. We are all full of stereotype about others. The stereotype of others become ours and affect yourself. Particularly when it is acceptable to expose them. Very few people will dare to say stupid think about people because of their color. We know it is false and offensive! But ask people what they think of foreigners and particularly illegal one and then you will hear a lot of more things... You have to protect yourself from it and ignore it. You can also argue with people but you can't do that with everybody... Most importantly you have to think of where all the stereotype you have come from and should you try to change them or ignore them? But this is America don't let people tell you what you can or can't do! (Is that a stereotype?)
