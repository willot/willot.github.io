          While I was in grade school I used to do field research every summer. My last two summer of field research I had the chance to be part of a group. We were helping each other with our field work. So it was common at the time that we will spend 10hour + in the field with no shade and very hot and humid temperature. So of use enjoyed it more than other.

          But after 10 hours of exhausting work every day you start to express your frustration a little more loudly that you will normally do. You are thirsty, you wonder what the hell this other person was thinking when they designed their experiment and so on... Then also people are tired and they are more sensitive to what you say. So it was not totally uncommon that we will argue in our 20 minute trip back  to the office. We all understood we were in together and conflict were forgotten the morning. Sometime it took longer than that.

          You really have to think of why you are upset. You often realize that is it trivial and you have to let it go.<br>
          When I speak to my friend we often joke about how we wanted to murder each other sometime. At the end it all become good memory.Let it go!
