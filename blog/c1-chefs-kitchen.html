    <h2> What I think about DBC</h2>
    <span id="date">9/20/2014</span>
    <div id="text_body"> 
        <p> I think like a lot of people that sign for DBC there is something in the back of your head telling you, what are you doing? In the same time there is this excitement to start something new. This is only the first week and I just start touching it. It really reminds me yhe first time I came in US (I am from France). I came in US 6 years ago and when I arrived my english was terrible. It still a work in progress until the day I die. I feel the same way about coding. I know nothing or very little and I know it will be a work in progress until the day I can't touch a keyboard anymore ( expect if they create computer that are mind control). </p>
        <p>  I remenber one of the most exciting things when I learned english is when I used a new word or an expression without consciously learning it. I am waiting for this moment I will try new things when I am coding just because it looks like a good idea at this moment. That is the moment you realize you are on the right pass. Then sometime you make a fool of yourself, give a good laugh to people and you laugh too.</p>
        <p> I really like what he explains in the video when someone ask him about learning another language. We are going to learn ruby but we are learning more than that. We are learning coding. I guess it is like learnig a third language when you already know two. It is getting easier!</p>
