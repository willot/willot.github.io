    <h2>Learning style and mindset/ French versus US learning</h2>

        <p>Today I am looking back at the results that I got from this <a  href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">test</a> . I scored the higher amount of point in AS (Abstract sequential). But my score is almost equal in all the section. I scored the lowest in AR (abstract random). Looking at all the categories and what each is good at and bad at, I clearly recognize myself in the AR but not at everything. There is clearly things that apply to me in other categories too. </p>
        <p> I spent a lot of time in school and for most of it, I really enjoyed it. Someone asked me one day what I learned in school. I told him "I learned to learn", I also learned to adapt. I am from France where I completed a Bachelor's and a Master's in an engineering school.  In the US, university is more prestigious than engineering school but in France it is reverse. It is very hard to enter one of these schools. You have to have good grades in high school, good reference letters, good application, good result to the exam called Bac at the end of high school and then you also have to pass an extremely hard entrance examination. It is a two day exam with 4 hours chemistry, 4 hours biology, 4 hours physics and 4 hour mathematics. If you are selected it doesn't stop there. You have 36 to 40 hours of class every weeks and you have only one test at the end of each class. You need to have an average above 10/20 at the end of the year, otherwise you are kicked out. They kick people out regularly. I got kicked out at the end of my first year but sense my average was very close to 10, they told me if I spent one year in university and got very good grades I could come back. I fought my way back and every year after that I fought to the last exam to get my average of 10.</p>
        <p> It was a real change when I came to study in US. The systems are very different. It is not the same approach of learning. In US people try to give you confidence you can do it and in France they tell you to fight if you want it. In the US you are really pushed  to work in groups and be part of something. In France you are forced  to be more individualistic. One really valuable lesson that I learned in the French system is that failure is part of life and it is ok. It is not the end of the world. Give your best and if it doesn't work, change what you do or where you want to go. What I learned in US is to learn from your peers. When I was in grad school I met very smart people some will say genius. In France people will have seen them as a threat to their success because it is so selective. Here in US it was more about what can we learn from each other. </p>
        <p>My conclusion is that if you have the opportunity to be around smart people work with them. You will always learn from them and they will learn from you too. You will always be better in team that by yourself. There is an exception to that. If the team only serve the benefit of one or two person, that will never work. You need to work together and not for someone. </p>
