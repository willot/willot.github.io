        <p>The subject of the day is the "Class".  Classes are very important and useful. They let you create series of methods that are building on each other using the same data and variables. You can call a variable in your method that was use in the previous method. You can also use sub class and use variables from the mother Class into the sub Class. You have several options to be able to use variables from one class to another one.<br>
        attr_reader: let you read the variables<br>
        attr_writer: let you overwrite the value of the variable<br>
        attr_accessor: let you overwrite and read. <br>
        Another thing about class is that you can initialize them. You can set the variables and the parameter for the class. 
        </p>
        <p>One example where class can be very useful is let say you have a business and you bill your customer every months. 
        In main class you will basically have a data base of the customer information like name, address, billing address, service... In this class you will set the customer information has only readable for the other classes.<br> 
        Then you will have a class where you set the price for the different service. Let say our business is to take care of lawns. You could have a 6 months billing where customers pay for the 6 months of service. You could also give a 12 month option to make the bill cheaper every month. You could also have premium or basic service... So lot of options...<br>
        Then you will have a class billing . In this class you will read all the information from the previous classes and generate a bill in function of their contract. 
        You could even have another class where payment information are stored... 
        </p>
        <p>The classes help you organize and create barrier so when you do the billing you couldn't change the price or address by mistake.  You can do the billing automatic while data entering is manual. The sky is the limit.</p>
