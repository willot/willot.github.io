    <h2>Les deux font la paire - Feedback and Pairing</h2>
    <span id="date">10-19-2014</span>
    <div id="text_body"> 
        <p>I almost spent 5 years working in research environment and feedback is something that I did a lot. I got feedback from major professor, committee members, from presentation, from other grad students. It is not always good and nice comments but they are useful. They help guide your project. I never took critics too hard because I know they are made to help me. I think it is nice to have comments from someone else to point out things. Half of the time you already know it, but you don't think it is an issue or you think you don't need to change. In my case one of the critic that I receive the most is that I don't always express myself clearly. I have this bad habit to think out loud a little so I guess people don't know what I am saying. I also start speaking then change my idea and stop my sentence in the middle... I think it come from the habit to work a lot by myself, but when I work with other person it makes them question what I am saying...</p>
        <p>Feedback come from pairs. Working with pairs is not always easy. I am used to work a lot by myself so it is nice change to work with someone. It usually go faster because the other person catch things that you miss and bring more ideas. Pairing with a new person can be hard. Working for the first time with someone that you don't know can be weird and awkward. We all have different personality. Some click and match very easily some don't. I think it is easier to pair with someone when you know each other a little. You can already know how the person is, you know what to expect. </p>
        <p>After pairing you have to write a feedback. This can be also weird. You spend an hour with someone you never met and you have to tell them what they should do better... You don't know them, you don't really know what was on their mind... So when the pairing go well it is easy but when the pairing was harder, is it because of them, because of you or, because of the combination of the two of you... I don't like giving comment to people that I don't know. I found easier to give comments to people with who I paired more than once because I get a better idea of what was working and what we can improve. </p>
