    <h2>Id versus classes in Html/CSS</h2>

        <p> I chose to speak about Id and class for the subject of this post. I took this subject because it was a little confusing for me. I didn't see the difference at first. I put Id or class in my html file. Then when I applied the CSS, the only difference I saw was the way I was calling for them using #Id or .class.
        </p>
        <p> So I do what everybody do, I google it. This question pop-up pretty often in forums. In general, the answer is pretty short but get the main idea. Id has to be unique. It can only refer to one element. Class on the opposite don't have to be unique. Several element can have the same class. Another thing is that you can combine them. You can have for a div id="babar" class="elephant". There is only one babar but you can have a lot of elephant (if we stop poaching them, but that is another subject)!

        <p> I digged a little bit more and found this pretty cool post wrote by Chris Coyier. http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/ . I learn a little more about ID and class with it. For example the Id have a # value. This means you can type in your URL and it will try to find the part of the page that refer to this Id. Chris give this example on his post "http://yourdomain.com#comments". If you type this URL you will go directly to the part of the page that refer to the comments Id. Apparently Javascript also use the Id. I never touch Java Script yet so I will refer you again to Chris page.
